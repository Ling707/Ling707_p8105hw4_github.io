# Problem 1

- A brief introductory landing page
  - This is a website for p8105 homework.
  - Also, I want you to know how cute Linabell is. Disney, take my money!
- Click [about me](about.html) to see my academic and professional experience.
- My e-mail is on the navigation bar (upper right).
- My Github page is beside my e-mail.


# Problem 2

- The flexdashboard for problem 2 is [here](problem2.html)
- You can also see it at the navigation bar.

- This is what you really want, right? I always get confused on the homework's instructions.
